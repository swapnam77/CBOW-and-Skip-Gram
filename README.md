# CBOW-and-Skip-Gram

CBOW and Skip Gram
Dataset: A book in the format of a txt file will be used as a dataset to obtain a bag of words and
skip gram representations.
Tasks:
1. Understand how the word2vec cbow model is generated using the gensim package.
2. Train a word2vec skip gram model with gensim package and compare the performance
with cbow model based on known similarity between words.
Submission: Make changes in Word2vec.ipynb file and submit the same in the portal.
Experiment 2:
Parts of Speech Tagging and Named Entity Recognition
Tasks:

choice.
2. List the named entities that you want a model to predict and check if the model predicts
those named entities for a sample sentence.
Submission: Make changes in POS_NER.ipynb file and submit the same in the portal
